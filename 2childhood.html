<h2><strong>Early Life</strong></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I grew up in the foster care system in NYC. Foster care, in itself, is a rough experience on anyone’s mental and emotional health. You always find yourself wondering why you? How come no body wants to keep you in their family? Do your parents even care if someone else wanted to adopt you? The list of doubts and insecurities pile up.
        The times that I did go to have stay over visits with my family, my father was verbally and physically abusive to both my siblings and I. He called us all kinds of names that we didn’t deserve at such a young age, crippling my already diminished sense of self-worth.
        That led me to go down a delinquent path of cutting school, being rude to people who didn’t deserve it, getting into fights, and all kinds of drama.
        Eventually I found myself in an abusive relationship, failing out of college, and struggling to keep food on my table.
        It took me months of therapy, two years of soul searching, and a lot of time spent talking and mostly crying it out with my friends for me to realize that I deserved better.
        That I deserve better.
        No one should ever feel less than. No one should ever feel like they don’t belong, or like they don’t shine as brightly as others do. 
        Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and with kindness.
        I can honestly say that without therapy and my friends as my support system, I would not be the person I am today. Everyday is a new day for me to learn and improve on myself. The best way to do that is to give back what I have learned along the way to someone else in need who might be a little further back on their road to self discovery.</p>
