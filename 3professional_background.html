        <p>I am dedicated, and hardworking when it comes to my future. For the past five years, I have been working towards gaining as many skills as I can that push me in the direction of my dreams, and goals. I have went from retail, and customer service jobs, to management positions. I’ve went for different types of job training, like getting my OSHA for construction, and joined a landscaping company. I am working to gain one new career skill each year to achieve my goal of being as self-sustaining as possible. I believe a career in tech is the best way to do just that. A career in tech is ideal to get me closest to my goal of time freedom, as well as financial freedom. 
        <br>

        I absolutely love to be challenged and stimulated mentally. I love learning, especially learning what I don’t know. Growing up, I have seen tech go from what felt like a minor side story in my life, to a main character. It has become an integral in the way I communicate with the outside world. To contact my family, to look for jobs, and to make this site. I see tech as being the future for every avenue of the job markets, and keeping up with the growth is the best way to maintain relevance. Getting in now at this pivotal moment of rapid growth in technology where things like AI, facial recognition, and even neural links are making their way to the forefront is extremely important. I believe it’s best to know how all of these programs work, or at least understand the basics.

        I want to be a software engineer because I consider myself to be a servant of the people. That’s not to say that I am not a leader. I most definitely am, but all good leaders must serve the people around them. Whether that be through sharing knowledge to help build each other up, or simply solving other people problems so that they might be able to move on up on their own.
        <br>
        <br>
        My whole life I’ve always known one thing, that I must help others. That’s whats always made me feel at peace. I’ve worked plenty of different jobs in order to achieve that goal. Most of them were customer facing, others were a little more low key, but still essential nonetheless. Each time I changed job descriptions, I went to continue on in that path of serving. Each time, I aimed for the best way that I could help a broader range of people. At this point in time, what I perceive the future to look like, a career in tech is the best way to do just that.

        Technology has grown in its reach across the globe. Everyday more and more people are using smartphones, laptops, computers, some form of computing. It’s become essential in our schools, hospitals, workplaces, and government. What better way to continue to serve the population than by participating in what connects us. What better way to serve than by continuing to learn how best to help people through our ever-growing technological advancements.
